##Introduction
#Hello and good afternoon. On behalf of the analytics team, we are pleased to present you our
#results and recommendations based on our analysis of the Beer & Brewery data. We will
#briefly be going over each of the questions in chronological order where we will provide
#our findings for each. Considering your schedules are very busy, our goal is to make sure
#this presentation is concise and to the point.

#Load in packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(naniar)
library(stringr)

#Read in Beers CSV
beer = read.csv(file.choose(), header=TRUE)

#Read in Breweries CSV
brew = read.csv(file.choose(), header=TRUE)


##Question 1
```{r}
#How many Breweries present in each state
brew %>%
  select(State)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, fill = State))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Total Number of Breweries in Each State")+
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=-0.5)
```

##Question 2
```{r}
#Change brewery label so it matches beer df
names(brew)[1] = "Brewery_id"

#Change brewery IDs to factors
beer$Brewery_id = as.factor(beer$Brewery_id)
brew$Brewery_id = as.factor(brew$Brewery_id)

#Join DF by Brewery ID's and show top and bottom 6
df = inner_join(beer,brew, by = "Brewery_id")

#Print top 6 observations of merged beer data frames
head(df)

#Print bottom 6 observations of merged beer data frames
tail(df)
```

##Question 3
```{r}
#Check for NA's... we can see ABV and IBU have NA's only
#1005 Missing Values for IBU
#62 Missing Values for ABC
gg_miss_var(df)
ibuc = df %>% filter(!is.na(IBU))
abvc = df %>% filter(!is.na(ABV))
dim(df)[1] - dim(ibuc)[1]
dim(df)[1] - dim(abvc)[1]
```

##Question 4
```{r}
#Compute median ABV and IBU for reach state. Then compare with bar chart. Handle NA's
#DC and Kentucky have the highest Median ABV with 0.0625
#Maine has the highest Median IBU with 61.0

#Compute Median of ABV by State
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(ABV))%>%
  group_by(State)%>%
  summarize(MedianABV = median(ABV))%>%
  arrange(desc(MedianABV))%>%
  print(n=50)

#Compute Median of IBU by State
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(IBU))%>%
  group_by(State)%>%
  summarize(MedianIBU = median(IBU))%>%
  arrange(desc(MedianIBU))%>%
  print(n=50)

#Create bar chart of median ABV for each State
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(ABV))%>%
  group_by(State)%>%
  summarize(MedianABV = median(ABV))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, y = MedianABV, fill=State))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  ggtitle("Bar Chart Distribution of Median ABV by State")
  
#Create bar chart of median IBU for each State
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(IBU))%>%
  group_by(State)%>%
  summarize(MedianIBU = median(IBU))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, y = MedianIBU, fill=State))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  ggtitle("Bar Chart Distribution of Median IBU by State")
```

##Question 5
```{r}
#Which state has the Highest ABV and IBU
#Highest ABV - Colorado, Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 - Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale @ 0.128ABV
#Highest IBU - Oregon, Oregon Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA @ 138IBU

#Scatter Plot to compute highest ABV
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(ABV))%>%
  group_by(State)%>%
  summarize(MaxABV = max(ABV))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, y = MaxABV, color=State))+
  geom_text(aes(label=State),hjust=0, vjust=0)+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Max ABV by State")+
  theme_gray()

#What value is the MAX ABV for Colorado?
coloradodf = df %>% filter(State == " CO")
coloradodf = coloradodf[order(coloradodf$ABV, decreasing=TRUE),]
head(coloradodf,1)

#Scatter Plot to compute highest IBU
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(IBU))%>%
  group_by(State)%>%
  summarize(MaxIBU = max(IBU))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, y = MaxIBU, color=State))+
  geom_text(aes(label=State),hjust=0, vjust=0)+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Max IBU by State")+
  theme_gray()

#What value is the MAX IBU for Oregon?
oregondf = df %>% filter(State == " OR")
oregondf = oregondf[order(oregondf$IBU, decreasing=TRUE),]
head(oregondf,1)
```

##Question 6
```{r}
#Distribution of ABV variable
#Distribution looks slightly right skewed
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(ABV))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ABV))+
  geom_histogram(fill="mediumpurple2", col= "lightcyan3", size=1)+
  ggtitle("Distribution of ABV Variable")

#Summary stats of ABV variable
#Min ABV - 0.1%
#Q1 - 5%
#Median ABV - 5.6%
#Q3 - 6.7%
#Max ABV - 12.8%
#Average ABV - 6%
df%>%
  filter(!is.na(ABV))%>%
  summarize(MeanABV = mean(ABV), SDABV = sd(ABV), MedianABV = median(ABV), MaxABV = max(ABV), MinABV = min(ABV), Q1 = quantile(ABV,0.25), Q3 = quantile(ABV,0.75), Range = max(ABV)-min(ABV), count = n())
```

##Question 7
```{r}
#Relationship between ABV and IBV(Bitterness)?
#We can see a positive linear correlation with IBU and ABV.
#AS the bitterness is higher, the ABV usually increases as well.
#This makes sense since the higher percentage of alcohol will most
#likely make your drink more bitter
df %>%
  filter(!is.na(ABV) & !is.na(IBU))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=IBU, y=ABV))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", col = "blue")+
  ggtitle("Relationship between IBU and ABV")
```

##Question 8
```{r}
#KNN Classification of IPA or Ale based on IBU and ABV explanatory variables
#Filter out Ale and IPA only
Aledf = df %>% filter(grepl("Ale",df$Style))
IPAdf = df %>% filter(grepl("IPA",df$Style))

#Create new DF
AleIPA = full_join(IPAdf,Aledf)
names(AleIPA)[1] = "Name"
names(AleIPA)[8] = "Brewery"

#Create new column of factors for Ale and IPA
Style_Type = c()
for(i in grepl("Ale",AleIPA$Style))
  {
  if(i == "TRUE")
    {
    Style_Type = c(Style_Type,"Ale")
    }else{
    Style_Type = c(Style_Type,"IPA")
    }
}

#Bind column to df
AleIPA = cbind(AleIPA,Style_Type)

#Turn Style_Type to factor
AleIPA$Style_Type = as.factor(AleIPA$Style_Type)

#Turn IBU to numeric
AleIPA$IBU = as.numeric(AleIPA$IBU)

#Check missing values
gg_miss_var(AleIPA)

#Filter them out to do training on data set
AleIPA = AleIPA %>% filter(!is.na(ABV) & !is.na(IBU))

##80/20 Test Train Set for kNN

#We would suggest to deploy a kNN model for predictive classification of Ale's vs IPA's with
#the highest accuracy percentage of 86.13% based on the features of ABV and IBU levels
```

##Question 9
```{r}
#Find any useful inference from data
#We would like to test and see if there is a difference in ABV averages for IPA vs Other Ale's
#More specifically, tests to see if Ale or IPA differ in regards to ABV
#First we will address assumptions of normality and equal standard deviations prior to 
#selecting the best test to administer for the question of interest above.

#Check Histogram distribution for normality
AleIPA %>%
  select(Style_Type,ABV)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ABV, fill = Style_Type))+
  geom_histogram()+
  ggtitle("Histogram Distribution of ABV for Ale & IPA")+
  facet_wrap(~Style_Type)
  
#Check QQPlots for any departures from normality
qplot(sample=ABV, data=AleIPA, color=Style_Type)+
  xlab("Quantile")+
  ylab("ABV")+
  ggtitle("QQPlot Distribution of ABV of Ale vs IPA")

##Normality Assumption
#The histograms show relatively normal distribution with some evidence of right skewness from
#Ale diagram. The QQplots also show some departures from normality, but not enough to discredit
#the normality assumption. Nonetheless, we have a large enough sample size to assert normality.
#We will now move to visually validate the equal standard deviation assumption.

#Check Box plot distribution for equal standard deviations
AleIPA%>%
  select(Style_Type,ABV)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Style_Type, y=ABV, fill=Style_Type))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle("Box Plot Distribution of ABV based on Ale vs IPA")+
  coord_flip()

#Check Dot plot distribution for equal standard deviations
AleIPA%>%
  select(Style_Type,ABV)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Style_Type, y=ABV, color=Style_Type))+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle("Dot Plot Distribution of ABV based on Ale vs IPA")+
  coord_flip()

##Equal Standard Deviations Assumption
#After viewing the box plots of the spread, we can see a lot more variability in the Ale Beer
#type vs IPA. There is not enough visual evidence to suggest equal standard deviations. 
#We will move forward on testing with unequal standard deviations

#Welch's T-Test is the most powerful testing tool for these assumptions stated above.
#We will run a test to see if the mean ABV value is different between Ale vs IPA.
t.test(ABV~Style_Type, data = AleIPA, var.equal = FALSE)

#Conclusion
#The evidence suggests that the mean average of ABV between groups "Ale" and "IPA" are
#different. We can stronly assert that the IPA group has a larger mean ABV than Ale drinks. A
#95% confidence interval will tell us there is [0.011,0.014] more ABV in IPA's vs Ale's. More
#specifically, IPA's hold about 1.1%-1.4% more ABV than other Ale's.

#Why is this important? This will allow the brewery company to assert the claim that their
#IPA's are stronger than other Ale's. They could then sell more IPA-based drinks in areas where
#higher ABV is preferred.

#Now we will create the logic for a heat map to see which states have highest average ABV
df$State = str_replace_all(df$State, fixed(" "), "")
stateabb = c()
for(i in df$State)
  {
  abbr = abbr2state(i)
  stateabb = c(stateabb,abbr)
  }

df = cbind(df,stateabb)
df$region = tolower(df$stateabb)
states = map_data("state")
statesdf = left_join(states,df, by="region")
statesdf = statesdf[order(statesdf$order),]

#Heat map showing the average ABV for each state
ggplot(statesdf, aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=ABV))+
  geom_path()+
  ggtitle("Heap Map of Average ABV for each state")+
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(heat.colors(10)),na.value="grey90")+
  coord_map()

#The Heat Map shows the average ABV across the US so we can give suggestions to CEO's from
#evidence provided above on which states they can focus selling more IPA drinks based on high
#ABV by State.
#The top 3 states with highest average ABV would be good targets to sell more IPA's.
